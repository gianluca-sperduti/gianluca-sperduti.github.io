## About Me

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Modern Literature from the University of Rome Tor Vergata in 2017. Subsequently, in 2019, I completed my Master's degree in Modern Philology at the University of Rome La Sapienza. Between 2020 and 2021, I had the opportunity to pursue a Master's degree in Big Data Analytics and Social Mining at the University of Pisa, which I successfully completed with top honors.
I gained practical experience working as a Data Science intern at Freeda Media and later as a Junior Data Specialist at Vantea Smart. Following that, I embarked on a research fellowship at ISTI-CNR under the supervision of Alejandro Moreo Fernandez and Fabrizio Sebastiani. Since October 2021, I have been actively pursuing my PhD in Artificial Intelligence, and I am currently continuing my journey in this field.

<strong>Visually-grounded embeddings</strong> - Hate speech and spam are increasingly prevalent in today's web, despite the use of sophisticated Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods to automatically detect such messages. Malicious users often employ homoglyph attacks to evade automatic censorship. A homoglyph attack involves substituting a character from the Latin alphabet with a visually similar character from another alphabet. For instance, the phrase 'I hate you' could be written as '| hàté yòù'. While this message is easily understandable to humans, it poses a challenge for NLP models, including character-based ones, as each character is assigned a different Unicode code.
To address this problem, I have begun experimenting with a novel approach that utilizes image pixels as character representation vectors. This enables resistance against homoglyph attacks and enhances the effectiveness of our detection system. Alongside Alejandro Moreo, I have submitted an extended abstract to the 13th edition of the Italian Information Retrieval conference, and I am currently working on a version to be submitted to an international journal.

<strong>Survey on NLP Models Resilient to Misspellings</strong> - I am currently working on a comprehensive survey on resilient methods for NLP models robust against misspellings. Given that the last comprehensive survey dates back to 2009, it is crucial to produce an accurate and up-to-date survey on this topic.
During the course of my work, I have identified five main methods for addressing the issue of misspellings in NLP: Data augmentation, Character-order agnostic methods, Double step with Text Normalization, Tuple-based methods, and Other Methods. These methods are being examined and analyzed in detail in the survey.
The survey is currently in its final stages of preparation, and I plan to submit it to an international journal soon. It aims to provide a comprehensive and thorough overview of the latest advancements and techniques for enhancing NLP models' resilience to misspellings.
