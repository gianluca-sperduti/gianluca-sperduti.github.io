## About Me

I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Modern Literature from the University of Rome Tor Vergata in 2017. Subsequently, in 2019, I completed my Master's degree in Modern Philology at the University of Rome La Sapienza. Between 2020 and 2021, I had the opportunity to pursue a Master's degree in Big Data Analytics and Social Mining at the University of Pisa, which I successfully completed with top honors.
I gained practical experience working as a Data Science intern at Freeda Media and later as a Junior Data Specialist at Vantea Smart. Following that, I embarked on a research fellowship at ISTI-CNR under the supervision of Alejandro Moreo Fernandez and Fabrizio Sebastiani. Since October 2021, I have been actively pursuing my PhD in Artificial Intelligence, and I am currently continuing my journey in this field.
